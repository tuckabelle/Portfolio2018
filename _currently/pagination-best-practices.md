description: Some users may prefer to customize viewing options for long lists, especially
  if the listings cannot be easily prioritized or are dependent on individual visual
  preference. Even if a “View All” option is present, there should be some kind of
  upper limit per page (around 100). Too many customization options can introduce
  usability issues, so try to stick to one alternative.
